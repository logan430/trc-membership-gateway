### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Stripe CLI not installed - webhook signature testing pending user setup
- Discord bot requires user setup (Developer Portal, bot token, guild invite)
- STRIPE_INDIVIDUAL_PRICE_ID must be set before testing checkout
- DISCORD_INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID must be set before testing introduction detection
- Message Content Intent must be enabled in Discord Developer Portal

## Phase 4 Progress

Introduction requirement progress:
- [x] 04-01: Message event infrastructure
- [ ] 04-02: Role promotion logic (next)
- [ ] 04-03: Subscription end handling

Delivered (04-01):
- Discord client with MessageContent and GuildMessages intents
- DISCORD_INTRODUCTIONS_CHANNEL_ID env configuration
- lastGuidanceDmAt field for rate-limiting guidance DMs
- Introduction message event handlers (messageCreate, messageUpdate)
- Channel filtering (only #introductions), bot filtering, reply filtering
