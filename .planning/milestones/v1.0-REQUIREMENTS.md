## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Full production VM deployment | MVP is local proof; deployment is post-MVP |
| Mobile app | Web-first approach; Discord mobile handles community access |
| Real-time chat features | Discord handles chat natively |
| CRM sync (HubSpot/Clay) | Export-ready only; actual sync is post-MVP |
| Multiple admins per company | Business partners pay for separate owner seats |
| OAuth providers beyond Discord | Discord is the only identity needed for this community |
| Trial periods | Pay-first model; no free trials |
| Refund automation | Manual refunds via Stripe dashboard |

## Milestone Summary

**Shipped:** 45 of 45 v1 requirements (100%)

**Adjusted:**
- Role names changed from generic (Paid Unintroduced, Member, Owner, Billing Issue) to medieval theme (Squire, Knight, Lord, Debtor) to align with "Revenue Council" branding
- Admin system requirements (ADMIN-01 through ADMIN-04) added during Phase 10 planning based on production readiness needs
- UI/Frontend requirements (UI-01 through UI-04) formalized during Phase 9 to capture frontend deliverables

**Dropped:**
- None - all defined requirements were delivered

**Notes:**
- Medieval role theme emerged as design decision in Phase 2 and was applied consistently
- Grace period before Debtor role (48 hours) was implemented in Phase 6, making BILL-V2-01 partially delivered
- Admin system was more comprehensive than initially scoped, including audit logs, feature flags, and template editing
