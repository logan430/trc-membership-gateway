<objective>
Test the complete Stripe checkout flow end-to-end in test mode: sign up a test user, complete Stripe checkout with a test card, verify the webhook fires and processes correctly, test payment failure handling, and test the billing portal.

Purpose: Configuration from 41-01 is verified by actually running the flows. This confirms webhooks fire, member status updates, payment failure grace periods work, and billing portal works -- covering STRIPE-03 through STRIPE-07.
Output: Verified end-to-end Stripe test mode flow with evidence (webhook logs, database state, payment failure handling, billing portal redirect).

NOTE: STRIPE-08 (live mode checkout) is formally deferred to Phase 43 (E2E Verification & Go-Live). Live mode involves real money and should be the final pre-launch step after all test mode flows are verified.

  <name>Task 1: User completes test checkout flow while Claude monitors</name>
  <what-built>Stripe webhook endpoint and env vars configured in 41-01. Now we need to verify the actual checkout flow works end-to-end.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  Complete these steps in your browser:

  **Step 1: Sign up a test account**
  1. Go to `https://app.therevenuecouncil.com/signup`
  2. Create a new account with a test email (e.g., `stripetest@example.com`)
  3. Use any password you like
  4. Confirm the account is created (you should be logged in or redirected)

  **Step 2: Initiate checkout**
  1. Navigate to the dashboard or billing page
  2. Click the button to subscribe / start checkout
  3. You should be redirected to a Stripe Checkout page

  **Step 3: Complete payment with test card**
  1. On the Stripe Checkout page, use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
  2. Expiry: any future date (e.g., `12/34`)
  3. CVC: any 3 digits (e.g., `123`)
  4. Name: any name
  5. Click "Subscribe" or "Pay"
  6. You should be redirected back to `https://app.therevenuecouncil.com/dashboard?checkout=success`

  **Step 4: Verify webhook in Stripe Dashboard**
  1. Go to Stripe Dashboard -> Developers -> Webhooks -> your endpoint
  2. Check "Recent deliveries" -- you should see a `checkout.session.completed` event with HTTP status 200

  **Report back:**
  - Did signup work?
  - Did checkout redirect to Stripe?
  - Did payment with test card succeed?
  - Did you get redirected back to the dashboard?
  - Does the Stripe webhook log show a 200 response for checkout.session.completed?

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify webhook processing and member status in database</name>
  <files><!-- No codebase files modified. This task queries production database state and app logs to verify webhook processing. --></files>
  <action>
  After the user confirms the checkout completed, verify the backend processed everything correctly:

  1. Check production logs for the webhook event:
     ```bash
     ssh root@82.180.160.120 "docker logs \$(docker ps --format '{{.Names}}' | grep express | head -1) --tail 100 2>&1" | grep -i "webhook\|checkout\|stripe\|ACTIVE\|subscription"
     ```
     If SSH is not available, ask the user to check Coolify logs.

  2. Verify the member's subscription status in the database. Query via the admin API:
     ```bash
     # First, get an admin JWT token
     ADMIN_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://app.therevenuecouncil.com/admin/auth/login \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"email":"logan@callamarketer.ca","password":"ADMIN_PASSWORD"}' | jq -r '.token')

     # Then check the members list for the test user
     curl -s https://app.therevenuecouncil.com/api/admin/members \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" | jq '.members[] | select(.email == "stripetest@example.com") | {email, subscriptionStatus, stripeCustomerId, subscriptionId}'
     ```

     NOTE: The admin password may not be known to Claude. If the admin API call fails with 401, ask the user to check the member status via the admin dashboard at `https://app.therevenuecouncil.com/admin/members`.

  3. Verify these fields on the test member:
     - `subscriptionStatus` should be `ACTIVE`
     - `stripeCustomerId` should be populated (starts with `cus_`)
     - `subscriptionId` should be populated (starts with `sub_`)

  4. Check that the StripeEvent was recorded (idempotency protection):
     If admin API has an endpoint for this, query it. Otherwise, note that the checkout.session.completed event should be logged in the StripeEvent table -- this ensures replay protection is working.

  5. Also verify the `invoice.paid` webhook was received:
     - Check Stripe Dashboard webhook logs for an `invoice.paid` event (fires automatically when subscription is created)
     - Confirm it shows HTTP 200 response
     - NOTE: Stripe renamed `invoice.payment_succeeded` to `invoice.paid`. The codebase handles `invoice.paid`, which satisfies requirement STRIPE-04.

  6. If any issues found:
     - Check Stripe Dashboard webhook logs for error responses
     - Check app logs for error messages
     - Report specific errors to the user with remediation steps
  </action>
  <verify>
  - Production logs show checkout.session.completed event received and processed
  - Test member has subscriptionStatus = ACTIVE
  - Test member has stripeCustomerId and subscriptionId populated
  - invoice.paid event received with 200 response in Stripe Dashboard webhook logs
  </verify>
  <done>
  checkout.session.completed and invoice.paid webhooks verified: both fire correctly, process with 200 response, and update member to ACTIVE status. Requirements covered: STRIPE-03 (checkout.session.completed processes correctly), STRIPE-04 (invoice.paid processes correctly -- Stripe renamed invoice.payment_succeeded to invoice.paid), STRIPE-07 (test mode checkout completes successfully).
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: User tests billing portal and payment failure handling</name>
  <what-built>Checkout flow verified. Now testing billing portal redirect and payment failure webhook handling.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
  **Part A: Test Billing Portal (STRIPE-06)**
  1. Log in as the test user at `https://app.therevenuecouncil.com/login`
  2. Navigate to the billing page or dashboard
  3. Click "Manage Billing" (or similar button that opens the Stripe billing portal)
  4. You should be redirected to the Stripe Customer Portal
  5. Verify you can see subscription details and payment method
  6. Click "Back to [site]" or close the portal -- you should return to `https://app.therevenuecouncil.com/app/dashboard`

  **Part B: Verify invoice.paid webhook (STRIPE-04)**
  1. In Stripe Dashboard -> Webhooks -> your endpoint -> Recent deliveries
  2. Look for an `invoice.paid` event (this should have fired automatically when the subscription was created)
  3. Confirm it shows HTTP 200 response
  4. NOTE: Stripe renamed `invoice.payment_succeeded` to `invoice.paid`. The codebase correctly handles `invoice.paid`.

  **Part C: Test payment failure (STRIPE-05) -- REQUIRED**
  This test is mandatory. Use the declining test card to verify payment failure handling:
  1. In Stripe Dashboard -> Customers -> find the test customer (`stripetest@example.com`)
  2. Click the customer, then go to their subscription
  3. Update the payment method to the declining test card: `4000 0000 0000 0341`
     - Click the subscription -> Update payment method -> enter `4000 0000 0000 0341`, exp `12/34`, CVC `123`
  4. Alternatively, in Stripe Dashboard create a manual invoice for this customer and attempt to charge the declining card
  5. Check webhook logs for `invoice.payment_failed` event with 200 response
  6. This confirms the webhook endpoint correctly receives and acknowledges payment failure events, which triggers the grace period handling in the codebase

  **Report back:**
  - Did the billing portal open correctly?
  - Could you see subscription details in the portal?
  - Did returning from the portal redirect to the correct URL?
  - Was an `invoice.paid` event visible in webhook logs with 200 status?
  - Did `invoice.payment_failed` fire and return 200 after using the declining card?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Report results for all three parts: billing portal test, invoice.paid verification, and payment failure test</resume-signal>
